# Dcloud
Dcloud adds support to synchronization your Deezer downloads between devices. Works only with deezer-grabber (check in my account)

Requirements:
  * SQLite
  * PHP (Tested with php7.3)
  * Apache2 or nginx

Just copy this script to your webserver, then change the token from default. It will automatically create sqlite db. And then just specify server url and token in deezer-grabber script
